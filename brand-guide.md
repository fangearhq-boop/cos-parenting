## Voice & Tone

### Overall Voice
COS Parenting speaks as a **fellow parent** — knowledgeable but never preachy, helpful but
never judgmental, fun but never dismissive. Think of the voice as "that friend at school pickup
who always knows what's going on this weekend."

### Platform-Specific Voice

#### X/Twitter
- **Concise and helpful**: Quick tips, news bites, event reminders
- **Community-oriented**: "COS parents—" or "Hey Springs families—"
- **Practical**: Lead with the useful info (date, time, place, age range)
- **Moderate emoji use**: 1-2 per post max
- Hashtag strategy: #COSParenting #ColoradoSprings #COSKids #PikesPeakParenting

#### Facebook
- **Conversational and warm**: Write as one parent talking to another
- **Longer-form**: 3-5 paragraphs for news/events, shorter for humor
- **Question-driven**: End posts with a question to drive comments
- **Emoji-friendly**: 2-4 per post is fine, but don't overdo it
- **No hashtags**: Facebook algorithm doesn't prioritize them
- **Humor posts**: Can be shorter, meme-like, designed for shares

### Content Tone by Pillar

| Pillar | Tone | Example |
|--------|------|---------|
| Local News | Informative, concerned, practical | "Here's what COS parents need to know about..." |
| Local Events | Excited, helpful, detailed | "This weekend is PACKED with family fun..." |
| National Parenting | Balanced, evidence-based, reassuring | "New research suggests... here's what it means for your family" |
| Evergreen | Warm, experienced, practical | "After talking to dozens of COS parents, here are the top..." |
| Humor | Relatable, self-deprecating, lighthearted | "Tell me you're a COS parent without telling me..." |

## Photo Sourcing

### Stock Photos
COS Parenting uses **free stock photos** from:
- **Unsplash** (unsplash.com) — high-quality, diverse family/parenting photos
- **Pexels** (pexels.com) — good variety, especially for lifestyle content

### Photo Selection Guidelines
1. **Diversity matters** — represent the full range of COS families (race, family structure, abilities)
2. **Authentic over posed** — candid-feeling photos outperform studio shots
3. **Local when possible** — if covering a specific COS location, use photos of that actual place
4. **Seasonal accuracy** — match the current Colorado weather/season in photos
5. **Kid-safe** — all photos should feel warm and appropriate for a family audience
6. **Horizontal orientation** — social media graphics are landscape format

### Photo Credit
- Unsplash: No credit required, but appreciated ("Photo by [name] on Unsplash")
- Pexels: No credit required
- Local photos: Always credit the photographer or source

## Canva Workflow

### Brand Kit Integration
When creating graphics in Canva:
1. Apply the COS Parenting brand kit for consistent fonts and colors
2. Use Poppins for headlines (Bold, Teal #0097A7 or White)
3. Use Nunito for subtitles (Semi-bold, White or Soft Gold #F4C542)
4. Add a semi-transparent Dark Slate (#2C3E50) overlay bar for text readability
5. Include the COS Parenting logo in a corner

### Design Style
- **Clean and modern** — avoid cluttered designs
- **Warm color palette** — teal + coral + gold feels friendly and trustworthy
- **Consistent layout** — use similar text placement across posts for brand recognition
- **Readable** — text must be legible even on mobile (minimum 24pt for overlay text)
