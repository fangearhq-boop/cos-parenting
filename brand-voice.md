# COS Parenting — Brand Voice Guide

## 1. Brand Personality

If COS Parenting were a person, they'd be **that parent at school pickup who always knows what's going on this weekend** — the one who texts the group chat with the free splash pad schedule before you even think to ask. They're warm, organized, genuinely helpful, and not above laughing at the chaos of parenting. They know the best playgrounds, which school districts are doing what, and they just read a hilarious study about toddler sleep habits. They never make you feel bad for not knowing something — they just share the info and move on.

## 2. Voice Attributes

### Helpful
- **We are**: Practical, informative, action-oriented. We lead with the info parents actually need — dates, times, locations, ages, costs.
- **We are not**: Preachy, lecture-y, or condescending. We never imply "you should have known this."
- **This sounds like**: "Heads up COS parents — D20 just moved spring break to March 23-27. Here's what you need to know."
- **This does NOT sound like**: "It's critical that all parents pay attention to the school calendar changes. Failure to note these dates could result in childcare issues."

### Warm
- **We are**: Friendly, inclusive, community-first. We use "we" language and speak parent-to-parent.
- **We are not**: Saccharine, fake-cheerful, or overly sentimental. No baby talk, no "mama bear" clichés unless used ironically.
- **This sounds like**: "We know mornings are chaos — here's a quick list of what's happening this weekend so you can plan ahead."
- **This does NOT sound like**: "Hey mama bears!! Are you READY for the most AMAZING weekend EVER with your little ones?! 🐻💕✨"

### Fun
- **We are**: Witty, self-aware, willing to laugh at the absurdity of parenting. We love a good data point that makes you laugh.
- **We are not**: Snarky, mean-spirited, or mocking. We never punch down at parents, kids, or parenting choices.
- **This sounds like**: "New study says the average parent says 'be careful' 147 times per playground visit. Honestly shocked it's that low."
- **This does NOT sound like**: "LOL parents these days are so paranoid about everything 🙄"

### Curious
- **We are**: Interested in the data, the research, the surprising findings. We love sharing "wait, really?" moments backed by actual studies.
- **We are not**: Academic, dry, or overwhelming with citations. We translate research into plain-language takeaways.
- **This sounds like**: "Okay so researchers just found that kids who eat dinner with their family 5x/week score higher on vocabulary tests. The data is actually wild."
- **This does NOT sound like**: "A longitudinal cohort study published in the Journal of Pediatric Research (n=4,200) demonstrated a statistically significant correlation (p<0.05) between family meal frequency and lexical development metrics."

### Local
- **We are**: Deeply rooted in Colorado Springs. We name neighborhoods, parks, schools, restaurants. We know the difference between D11 and D20.
- **We are not**: Generic "parenting page" content that could be from anywhere. If it doesn't connect to COS, it needs a COS angle.
- **This sounds like**: "The new playground at John Venezia Park is officially open and it's a game-changer — they added a toddler section and shade structures."
- **This does NOT sound like**: "Check out this new playground in your area!"

## 3. Audience Awareness

### Primary Audience
**Colorado Springs parents with kids ages 0-12.** Mix of:
- Stay-at-home parents looking for activities and connection
- Working parents who need quick, practical info
- Military families (Fort Carson, Peterson, Schriever) who are often new to the area
- Parents new to Colorado Springs who don't know the local landscape yet

### Secondary Audience
- Grandparents and caregivers in the COS area
- Parents of teens who still care about local news and events
- Local family-oriented businesses (potential sponsors/partners)

### What They Care About
- "What should we do this weekend?"
- "What's happening at my kid's school?"
- "Is this event worth the drive/money/effort?"
- "Am I the only one dealing with [parenting challenge]?"
- "What does this study/news actually mean for my family?"

### How They Want to Be Addressed
- As capable adults, not as people who need to be told how to parent
- Casually — they're scrolling Facebook during naptime, not reading a textbook
- With humor — parenting is hard and sometimes you just need to laugh about it
- With specifics — vague "check it out!" posts waste their limited time

## 4. Core Messaging Pillars

Listed in priority order:

### Pillar 1: Local Connection
"We help you make the most of raising kids in Colorado Springs."
Everything ties back to COS. National stories get a local angle. Events get specific details. This is what makes us different from every other parenting page.

### Pillar 2: Practical Value
"We give you the info you need so you can spend less time searching and more time with your kids."
Dates, times, locations, costs, age ranges, parking tips. We do the research so parents don't have to.

### Pillar 3: Data-Driven Insight
"We find the interesting studies and surprising data — and tell you what it actually means."
We don't do generic advice. We find the research, the surveys, the numbers that make parents say "huh, I didn't know that." Always with a fun or surprising hook.

### Pillar 4: Community & Humor
"Parenting is hard. Laughing about it together makes it better."
Relatable moments, funny polls, "tell me you're a COS parent without telling me." This is the content that gets shared and builds the community.

## 5. Tone Spectrum

The voice stays consistent across all channels. Tone shifts based on context:

| Context | Warmth | Fun | Authority | Urgency |
|---------|--------|-----|-----------|---------|
| Breaking local news (school closure, weather) | ●●●○○ | ●○○○○ | ●●●●○ | ●●●●● |
| Local event promotion | ●●●●○ | ●●●○○ | ●●○○○ | ●●●○○ |
| National study/data story | ●●●○○ | ●●●●○ | ●●●●○ | ●○○○○ |
| Evergreen guide/resource | ●●●●○ | ●●○○○ | ●●●●● | ●○○○○ |
| Humor/relatable post | ●●●●● | ●●●●● | ●○○○○ | ●○○○○ |
| Product recall/safety alert | ●●●○○ | ●○○○○ | ●●●●● | ●●●●● |

### Key Tone Rules
- **Never lose the warmth** — even safety alerts should feel like a concerned friend, not a government bulletin
- **Humor can coexist with info** — a study post can be both funny and informative
- **Urgency is reserved** — only for genuine time-sensitive content (event today, school closure, safety alert)
- **Authority comes from specifics** — cite the source, name the school, give the date. Authority isn't about tone, it's about accuracy.

## 6. Style Rules

### Grammar & Mechanics

| Rule | COS Parenting Standard | Example |
|------|----------------------|---------|
| Oxford comma | Yes | "parks, playgrounds, and splash pads" |
| Headings | Sentence case | "How to survive back-to-school week" |
| Contractions | Always use them | "we're" not "we are", "here's" not "here is" |
| Numbers | Spell out 1-9, numerals 10+ | "three playgrounds" but "12 events" |
| Percent | Use % symbol | "73% of parents" |
| Date format | Month Day, Year | "March 15, 2026" |
| Time format | 12-hour with MT | "3:00 PM MT" |
| Exclamation marks | Max 1 per post, never in articles | "This weekend is packed!" |
| ALL CAPS | Avoid — use bold for emphasis | Never "THIS IS AMAZING" |
| Emoji (Facebook) | 2-4 per post, natural placement | At sentence breaks, not mid-sentence |
| Emoji (X/Twitter) | 1-2 max | Opening or closing only |
| Emoji (Articles) | Never | Articles are emoji-free |

### Formatting Conventions
- **Bold** for emphasis and key details (dates, locations, prices)
- *Italic* for study names, publication titles, and new terms
- Links should be descriptive: "check the full schedule" not "click here"
- Questions go at the END of Facebook posts (drives comments)

## 7. Terminology

### Preferred Terms

| Use This | Not This | Notes |
|----------|----------|-------|
| COS | the Springs, C-Springs | "COS" is how locals abbreviate it |
| Colorado Springs | Co Springs, CS | Full name when space allows |
| parents | moms and dads | Gender-neutral, inclusive of all caregivers |
| kids | kiddos, littles, babies | "Kiddos" is OK occasionally on Facebook |
| families | moms | We speak to all parents/caregivers |
| D11, D20, D49 | District 11, District 20 | Use abbreviations locals recognize |
| Pikes Peak region | the Springs area | More specific, locally accurate |
| military families | army families | Inclusive of all branches at COS installations |
| free | no cost, complimentary | "Free" is clearer and more direct |
| this weekend | the upcoming weekend | Casual and immediate |

### Performance-Driven Language Policy
**Use what works.** If a phrase, format, or hook is popular on Facebook parenting pages, that's a signal it resonates — lean into it. Don't avoid proven language just because it's common. Monitor performance and only rotate away from a term/format when engagement data shows it's losing effectiveness.

Examples of high-performing Facebook parenting language to use freely:
- "Parenting hack" — proven engagement driver, use it
- "Game-changer" — works well for event/product recommendations
- "You need to know" — strong hook for news/alerts
- "Am I the only one" — reliable comment driver
- "Tag a parent who" — share magnet

Rotate or retire a phrase ONLY when post performance data shows declining engagement compared to alternatives. Track this in the performance review process.

### Terms to Avoid
These are avoided for inclusivity and accuracy reasons, not because they're popular:
- "Mama/mama bear/boy mom/girl dad" — too niche and exclusionary of other caregivers
- "Hubby/wifey" — feels dated and exclusionary
- "Kids these days" — dismissive tone
- "Back in my day" — nostalgia that can feel judgmental
- "Studies show" without citing the actual study — always name the source

### Inclusive Language
- Use "parents and caregivers" when being comprehensive
- Default to "they/them" for unknown individuals
- Represent diverse family structures (single parents, grandparent-led homes, same-sex parents, foster families, military families)
- Colorado Springs has a large military community — be mindful of deployment, PCS moves, and military-specific challenges
- Acknowledge economic diversity — not all families can afford paid events; always highlight free options
