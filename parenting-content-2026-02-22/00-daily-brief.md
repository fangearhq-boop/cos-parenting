**Priority Score:** 10

**Summary (2-4 sentences):**
A Colorado Springs Gazette guest column published February 20 highlights the serious lack of childcare in Colorado Springs, citing a UCCS study showing 26% of parents who would otherwise work stay home due to childcare challenges. This lands alongside ongoing federal uncertainty — the Trump administration's freeze on $10 billion in child care funding continues to affect Colorado families and providers. The City of Colorado Springs is considering zoning changes to reduce barriers to childcare capacity. This is the lead story because it directly affects COS parents' daily lives and wallets.

### STORY 5: CPSC Recalls: Children's Sleepwear and Baby Swings
**Content Pillar:** National Parenting
**Freshness Tag:** TODAY
**Tier:** 2
**Assigned Platforms:** X Text Post + Facebook Long-Form + Facebook Image Caption + Image Concepts (X + FB) + Article
**Priority Score:** 8

**Summary (2-4 sentences):**
Multiple CPSC recalls dropped this month affecting kids' products. The biggest: Meijer recalled 211,520 units of Lullaby Lane and MCS children's sleepwear (Feb 19) for violating flammability standards, Vevor baby swings recalled for suffocation hazard, and baby bath seats recalled for drowning risk. CPSC also issued an urgent warning about HiQiLi wintergreen essential oil posing a deadly poisoning risk to young children.

### STORY 6: 2026 Parenting Trend: Boundaries With Empathy
**Content Pillar:** National Parenting
**Freshness Tag:** TRENDING
**Tier:** 3
**Assigned Platforms:** X Text Post + Facebook Long-Form + Facebook Image Caption + Image Concepts (X + FB)
**Priority Score:** 5

**Summary (2-4 sentences):**
The gentle parenting backlash has arrived — but what's replacing it is actually better. Therapist David Bruce notes gentle parenting "got confused with permissive parenting" and the new trend is "boundaries with empathy" — combining "I get how you feel" with "Here's the limit." Fewer than 40% of Gen Z parents say they use gentle parenting. This is prime engagement content because every parent has an opinion on this topic.

### STORY 7: COS Weather Whiplash: 23°F Today, 63°F Tomorrow
**Content Pillar:** Humor
**Freshness Tag:** TODAY
**Tier:** 3
**Assigned Platforms:** X Text Post + Facebook Long-Form + Facebook Image Caption + Image Concepts (X + FB)
**Priority Score:** 6

**Summary (2-4 sentences):**
Classic Colorado Springs: it's 23°F this morning, yesterday's high was only 39°F, but tomorrow's forecast calls for 63°F. The city nearly broke a 30-year temperature record earlier this month and El Paso County has Stage II fire restrictions in effect despite the cold snap. This is peak "tell me you're a COS parent without telling me" content — do you send your kid to school in a parka or shorts when the temperature swings 40 degrees in 24 hours?
