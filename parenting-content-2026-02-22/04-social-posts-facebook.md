## STORY 1: COS Childcare Crisis: Federal Cuts Meet Local Shortage
**Tier:** 1 (Local News)
**Posting Windows:** 8:00 AM (Long-Form), 8:00 PM (Image Caption)

### Long-Form Post

If you've thought about staying home instead of going back to work, you're not alone — and it's not just about preference anymore. A recent UCCS study found that **26% of COS parents would actually be working right now if childcare was accessible and affordable**. That's not a small number. That's our neighbors, our friends, people at our kids' schools making impossible choices between paychecks and peace of mind. 💔

Here's what's making it worse: the Trump administration just froze **$10 billion in federal child care funding**, and our local Child Care Assistance Program has been paused for over a year. If you've been waiting for help, you're waiting in limbo. El Paso County parents are feeling this squeeze hard, and military families at Fort Carson and Peterson Air Force Base are facing some of the toughest situations—they're already managing so much, and affordable childcare shouldn't be one more battle.

The good news? Our city's actually paying attention. **Colorado Springs is considering zoning changes to expand childcare capacity**, which could be a real game-changer for families like ours. It's not happening overnight, but at least there's movement. This is one of those issues where we all benefit when one parent can afford to stay in the workforce—whether that's extra income for their family, more diversity in our schools, or just more parents who aren't running on empty.

What's your biggest childcare challenge right now? Is it cost, availability, or finding someone you actually trust? I'm curious what's keeping families in our area from work. 👇

## STORY 3: Colorado Child Support Changes March 1
**Tier:** 2 (Local News)
**Posting Window:** 3:00 PM

### Long-Form Post

Big heads-up for co-parents in Colorado: **new child support calculations are taking effect March 1, 2026—that's literally one week away**. If you've been paying or receiving support, this is something you need to know about. 📋

This isn't a tiny tweak. It's a **major revision to how Colorado calculates child support**, and it's designed to be more equitable across the board. Depending on your situation, some cases are seeing adjustments around **10% higher support awards**, though every case is different based on income, custody time, and other factors. The point is: don't be blindsided. If you share custody or have support arrangements, now's the time to review your numbers and understand what might change.

If you're navigating co-parenting finances, reach out to a family law professional or check the Colorado Department of Human Services website for the detailed breakdown. This affects real money and real families, so it's worth getting clarity before March 1 hits. 💙

Do you have questions about how this affects your family's situation? 👇

School shopping is such a personal thing. Maybe your kid thrives with a different teaching style, maybe you want them closer to family, or maybe they've found a program that's the perfect fit. Whatever your reason, D20 gives you real options, and **you've got about three weeks to submit**.

Here's a bonus if you're in hiring mode anyway: **D20's hosting a Spring Job Fair on February 28 at 9:00 AM at Liberty High School**. If you work in schools or are looking to, it's worth the trip.

## STORY 5: CPSC Recalls: Sleepwear & Baby Products
**Tier:** 2 (National Parenting)
**Posting Window:** 10:00 AM

### Long-Form Post

Real talk: I hate that I have to post about recalls, but **the CPSC just issued several product safety alerts that affect kids' items, and some are serious**. Please check your homes and your kids' drawers—this matters. 🚨

Here's what's been recalled: **Meijer children's sleepwear (211,520 units) over burn hazard concerns**, Vevor baby swings (suffocation risk), baby bath seats (drowning hazard), HiQiLi wintergreen essential oil without child-resistant packaging (deadly poisoning risk—this one's especially urgent), Bellabu Bear children's robes (burn hazard), and Outdoor Master children's helmets (head injury risk). If you've got any of these items, **stop using them immediately and contact the manufacturer for a refund**.

I know it's overwhelming—there are always recalls, and it can feel paranoid to check everything. But some of these involve really vulnerable moments (bath time, sleep time, essential oils) where one problem can escalate fast. Take five minutes today to look through your house. Do a quick mental audit of your kids' sleepwear brands. Check that first-aid kit for anything suspicious. **If you find a recalled product, get it out of circulation right now**—refunds exist so you can replace it safely. 💙

Have you received any recall notices about items at your house recently? What made you check? 👇

## STORY 6: Boundaries With Empathy
**Tier:** 3 (National Parenting)
**Posting Window:** 5:00 PM

### Long-Form Post

Real parenting talk: Remember when everyone was doing "gentle parenting," and then suddenly it felt like half the kids were... out of control? Yeah, there's a reason. Therapist David Bruce nailed it: the concept **"got confused with permissive parenting,"** and a lot of parents ended up without actual boundaries. That's not gentle parenting. That's just chaos with good intentions. 💭

Here's what's actually working now: **"boundaries with empathy."** Picture it: your kid's melting down about screen time ending. Old gentle parenting might be "I see you're upset, let's keep playing." New approach: "I get how you feel—that game was so fun. Here's our time limit, and here's what we're doing next." You're honoring their emotions AND holding the line. It's both/and, not either/or. **Over 50% of parents are intentionally cutting phone use in 2026**, and it's because they're realizing connection doesn't come from saying yes to everything—it comes from **showing up with 10 minutes of real, undivided attention every day**.

The trend right now is "going analog"—less screens, more of us actually present with our kids. And honestly? It works. Your kid doesn't remember the night you said no to an extra hour of TikTok. They remember the night you sat on the kitchen floor and built Legos together without checking your phone once. 💙

How are you navigating screen time and boundaries in your house? What actually works with your kids? 👇

**Gentle parenting evolved:** Boundaries + empathy = "I get it AND here's the limit." 50% of parents cutting phone use in 2026. Real connection happens in 10 minutes of actual presence. 💙

## STORY 7: COS Weather Whiplash: 23°F Today, 63°F Tomorrow
**Tier:** 3 (Humor)
**Posting Window:** 12:00 PM

### Long-Form Post

Tell me you're a Colorado Springs parent without telling me you're a Colorado Springs parent:

Yesterday's high was 39°F. Today it's 23°F. And tomorrow? **Try 63°F—a swing of 40 degrees in 24 hours**. 🌡️ I'm not even exaggerating when I say earlier this month we nearly broke a 30-year temperature record. This is just how we live here, I guess.

The absolute *chef's kiss* of this situation? **We still have Stage II fire restrictions in effect despite it being freezing**. So we're dealing with dangerous cold AND wildfire preparedness simultaneously. Only in the Springs. Meanwhile, every parent in town is doing the weekly laundry triple-check: "Okay, which coat does each kid actually need TODAY?" because the answer changes literally every day. 😅

Your dryer is running more often than it's off. Your weather app notifications have notifications. You've built at least three outfits for each kid "just in case." And you've definitely had the "just grab a hoodie" conversation that ended with you digging out a full winter coat anyway. Welcome to February in COS. We wouldn't have it any other way. 💙❄️

What wild outfit combo did your kid rock today thanks to our temperature schizophrenia? 👇

**COS weather in a nutshell:** 23°F today, 63°F tomorrow. 40-degree swing. 30-year record almost broken. Stage II fire restrictions + freezing cold. Only here. 🌡️❄️
