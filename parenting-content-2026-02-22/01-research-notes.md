### STORY 1: COS Childcare Crisis: Federal Cuts Meet Local Shortage

   - Type: News article

3. UCCS Study (referenced in Gazette column) - 2025-2026
   - URL: Referenced in Gazette column
   - Type: Academic study

#### Key Facts & Stats

- 26% of COS parents who would otherwise work stay home due to childcare challenges (UCCS study)
- Trump administration froze $10 billion in federal child care and family assistance funding
- Child Care Assistance Program has been on pause for over a year in Colorado
- El Paso County is among counties grappling with funding cut aftermath
- City of Colorado Springs is considering zoning changes to reduce barriers to increasing childcare capacity
- Federal policy faces ongoing legal challenges
- Childcare shortage is both a local infrastructure problem and a federal funding problem

#### Freshness Verification

- **Reported by:** Colorado Springs Gazette
- **First Reported:** February 20, 2026 (guest column)
- **Latest Update:** February 22, 2026 (ongoing federal uncertainty)
- **Aging Status:** FRESH
- **Confidence Level:** High — based on local newspaper and local news station

#### Why This Matters (to COS Parenting audience)

This is the single biggest practical issue for COS parents right now. If you're a working parent or want to be, finding affordable, available childcare in Colorado Springs is incredibly difficult. The UCCS stat — one in four parents who'd work staying home instead — is staggering and directly affects family budgets, career trajectories, and quality of life.

The federal angle adds urgency: even if COS fixes local zoning, federal cuts to child care assistance mean families who need subsidized care may not get it. Military families at Fort Carson and Peterson who rely on federal programs are especially vulnerable. This story connects to nearly every segment of the COS Parenting audience.

#### Cross-Story Connections

- **Relates to Story #3:** Child support changes (family financial pressure)
  - Connection: Both stories involve financial stress on COS families — childcare costs and child support changes compound each other.
