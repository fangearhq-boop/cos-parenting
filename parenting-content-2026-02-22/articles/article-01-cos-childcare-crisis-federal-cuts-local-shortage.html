            <p>If you've been struggling to find childcare in Colorado Springs, you're not alone—and the problem just got significantly worse. A combination of frozen federal funding and long-standing local shortages is creating what experts are calling a childcare crisis that's directly affecting thousands of families across the Pikes Peak region.</p>
            <p>For many parents in COS, the question isn't just about convenience anymore. It's about whether they can afford to work at all. The numbers are sobering, and they hit close to home.</p>

            <h2>The Local Impact: What Colorado Springs Families Are Facing</h2>
            <p>A recent University of Colorado at Colorado Springs (UCCS) study revealed a troubling reality: 26% of Colorado Springs parents who would otherwise work stay home specifically because of childcare challenges. That's more than one in four families making the difficult choice to sacrifice income—and career momentum—because they can't find or afford quality care for their children.</p>
            <p>This isn't a minor inconvenience. These are families in our neighborhoods—in the Manitou Springs area, on the east side near Powers Boulevard, in Fountain, and throughout El Paso County—making major life decisions because childcare simply isn't available or accessible.</p>
            <p>The impact extends beyond just parents who stay home. Those who do manage to find childcare often pay a staggering portion of their income for it. Many COS families are spending 20-30% of their household income on child care, which financial experts suggest should be no more than 7%. That kind of financial squeeze means less money for rent, food, healthcare, and other necessities.</p>

            <h2>Federal Funding Freeze: Understanding the Bigger Picture</h2>
            <p>If local shortages weren't enough, the Trump administration's decision to freeze $10 billion in federal child care and family assistance funding has made everything worse. This isn't just a Colorado Springs problem—it's happening nationwide. But the impact on individual families here in our community is very real.</p>
            <p>Colorado's own Child Care Assistance Program has been paused for over a year, which means lower-income families who were receiving help paying for childcare have lost that crucial support. Families who were barely managing with assistance are now completely priced out of the childcare market.</p>
            <p>Military families at Fort Carson, Peterson Space Force Base, and Schriever Space Force Base have been especially hard hit. These families are already managing the unique challenges of military life—and many depend on military childcare facilities that have capacity issues of their own. Without federal support, they're watching their childcare costs skyrocket just like everyone else.</p>
            <p>The federal policy is facing ongoing legal challenges from advocacy groups and states, including Colorado, but for families dealing with this crisis right now, that's cold comfort.</p>

            <h2>What's Happening Locally to Address the Crisis</h2>
            <p>Colorado Springs isn't sitting idle. The City of Colorado Springs is actively considering zoning changes designed to reduce barriers to childcare capacity. These regulatory changes could make it easier for childcare providers to open new facilities or expand existing ones, though the process takes time and involves community input.</p>
            <p>Some providers are getting creative, offering non-traditional hours to serve parents who work evenings or shifts. Others are partnering with employers to subsidize care or offer on-site facilities. But these efforts, while helpful, can't make up for the systemic shortage and the loss of federal support.</p>
            <p>The reality is that without more funding—either federal dollars being restored or new local and state investments—the situation won't improve quickly. Childcare facilities are expensive to operate, and providers already working on thin margins can't absorb the loss of federal assistance without cutting services or raising prices even higher.</p>

            <h2>What's Next</h2>
            <p>For families in Colorado Springs right now, the path forward involves both immediate action and longer-term hope. If you're struggling with childcare decisions, reach out to local organizations that offer resources and support. Stay informed about the ongoing legal challenges to the federal funding freeze—outcomes could change the landscape for COS families. Watch local news for updates on the City's zoning initiatives, which could expand provider options within months. And remember: you're not alone in this. Thousands of COS families are facing these same impossible choices and systemic barriers.</p>
            <p>The federal policy faces court challenges. State and local leaders continue advocating for support. New providers are being encouraged through zoning changes. These shifts take time, but change is moving—and COS Parenting will keep you updated as the situation evolves.</p>
