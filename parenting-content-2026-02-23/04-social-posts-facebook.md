## STORY 1: COS Childcare Crisis: Zoning Fast-Track Sparks Neighborhood Debate
**Tier 1** | Posting Window: 10:00 AM MT

### Long-Form Post

If you've ever spent months on a childcare waitlist, this one's for you.

Colorado Springs has **47,000 kids under 5** and only **18,400 licensed childcare spots**. That math doesn't work, and the city knows it. Right now, **26% of parents** who want to work are staying home because they literally can't find care. So the city is fast-tracking zoning changes that would allow daycares to open in residential neighborhoods — places where families actually live.

Here's where it gets complicated. Some neighborhoods are pushing back, not on the idea itself, but on the speed. They want more time to weigh in on what this looks like on their streets — traffic, parking, noise. Those are fair questions. But parents who've been piecing together patchwork childcare for years are saying we can't afford to wait another 12 months for more studies.

This is one of those issues where almost everyone agrees on the problem but not on how fast to fix it. The city is trying to move quickly because the crisis is already here. We'll be following this closely.

Where do you land — should the city fast-track this, or slow down and get more neighborhood input first?

## STORY 2: CPSC Safety Alert: Baby Bath Seats, Walkers, and Loungers Recalled
**Tier 1** | Posting Window: 8:00 AM MT

### Long-Form Post

Parents, sharing this one because it's important. The CPSC just issued multiple recalls on baby products, and they're all items sold on Amazon that a lot of us have probably scrolled past or even purchased.

Here's what's been recalled:
- **Baby bath seats** — drowning risk, roughly **9,000 units** sold through Amazon
- **Infant walkers** — fall and entrapment hazard
- **Baby loungers** — entrapment and fall risk
- **Teething toys** — choking hazard

If you have any of these, **stop using them immediately**. Don't donate them, don't pass them along. Check your order history if you're not sure — these were all sold through Amazon, so it's easy to search.

We know recalls happen all the time and it's hard to keep track. That's why we share them. A quick check today could prevent something serious tomorrow.

Have you found any recalled products in your home recently? Drop a comment so other parents know what to look for.

## STORY 3: Spring Break 2026: Every COS District Has Different Dates
**Tier 2** | Posting Window: 1:00 PM MT

### Long-Form Post

If you have kids in different COS districts, you already know the headache. Spring break dates don't line up, and this year is no exception.

Here's what we're looking at:
- **D49: March 16-27** — that's a full **two weeks** off
- **Falcon/FFC8: March 23-27** — one week

That means if you've got one kid in D49 and another in a different district, you're juggling completely different schedules. And it's only **3-4 weeks away**, so if you haven't locked down camps or childcare coverage yet, now's the time.

Camps fill up fast this time of year, especially the affordable ones. Don't assume you'll figure it out later — later is basically here.

How are you handling spring break this year? Found any good camps or programs that still have openings?

Spring break is 3-4 weeks away and COS districts are on completely different schedules. D49 gets TWO weeks off. Time to plan.

## STORY 4: Letting Teens Sleep In on Weekends May Cut Depression Risk 41%
**Tier 2** | Posting Window: 3:00 PM MT

### Long-Form Post

For every parent who's ever fought with their teenager about sleeping until noon on Saturday — science may have just handed them a win.

A new study from the **University of Oregon**, published in the **Journal of Affective Disorders**, looked at roughly **1,100 young people ages 16-24** and found that weekend catch-up sleep was linked to a **41% lower risk of depression**. This is the first major US study to find this connection, and it backs up what a lot of sleep researchers have been saying: it's completely normal for teens to be night owls. Their brains are wired for it.

This doesn't mean we throw out all structure. School nights still matter. But if your teen is catching extra sleep on weekends, they might actually be doing something healthy for their mental health — not just being lazy.

So maybe this weekend, let them sleep. You can quietly enjoy your coffee in peace. Everybody wins.

Did this change how you feel about your teen's weekend sleep schedule, or were you already team "let them rest"?

New study says letting teens sleep in on weekends could lower their depression risk by 41%. Science says put down the alarm clock.

## STORY 5: D20 Spring Job Fair Saturday + D11 Launches STEM Challenge
**Tier 2** | Posting Window: 5:00 PM MT

### Long-Form Post

Two quick things happening in local schools this week that are worth knowing about.

First, **Academy District 20** is hosting a spring job fair this **Saturday, February 28** at **Liberty High School starting at 9:00 AM**. If you're looking for work in education — or know someone who is — this is a great chance to connect with hiring teams in person. Teachers, support staff, admin roles, all of it.

Second, **D11 has launched a STEM Challenge** running from **February through April 2026**. This is a great opportunity for students who love science, tech, engineering, and math to get involved in hands-on projects and competitions.

If either of these fits your family, share this with someone who could use it.

Anyone heading to the D20 job fair Saturday? What positions are you hoping to find?

**Tier 3** | Posting Window: 7:00 PM MT

### Long-Form Post

Looking for something fun to do with the family in the next couple of weeks? Two great events are coming up.

**Starsmore Discovery Center** has family programming this **Saturday, February 28 at 9:00 AM**. If you haven't been out there, it's a beautiful spot and a great way to get kids outside and learning. Perfect for younger kids especially.

Then mark your calendar for **Saturday, March 7** — the **Polar Plunge & 5K** at **Rock Ledge Ranch, starting at 9:00 AM**. This one benefits **Special Olympics Colorado**, so it's fun for a great cause. Whether you're brave enough to plunge into freezing water or just want to cheer on the people who are, it's a fantastic family outing.

Both events are free or low-cost and great ways to get out of the house before spring officially hits.

Which one are you more likely to show up to — Starsmore or the Polar Plunge?

## STORY 7: The 5 Stages of Planning Spring Break When Every District Has Different Dates
**Tier 3 (Humor)** | Posting Window: 12:00 PM MT

### Long-Form Post

The 5 Stages of Spring Break Planning in Colorado Springs:

**Stage 1 — Denial.** "I'm sure all the districts have the same week off. They wouldn't make it complicated for no reason." (They would. They did.)

**Stage 2 — Anger.** "WHO designed these calendars? Did they even LOOK at each other's dates? Do they WANT us to suffer?"

**Stage 3 — Bargaining.** "Maybe grandma can take the kids that extra week. Or maybe I can work from home. Or maybe the kids are old enough to just... be fine? They're 7."

**Stage 4 — Depression.** "I now need three separate childcare plans, two different camp registrations, and a time machine. Cool. This is fine."

**Stage 5 — Acceptance.** "At least it's not summer scheduling. That's four different calendars and a spreadsheet."

Tag a parent who's currently stuck somewhere between Stage 2 and Stage 4.

If you have kids in different COS districts, spring break planning just became a personality test. Which stage are you in?
