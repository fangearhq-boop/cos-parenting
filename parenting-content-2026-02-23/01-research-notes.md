#### Key Facts & Stats

- 47,000 children under 5 in El Paso County, but only 18,400 licensed childcare spots — a deficit of roughly 28,600 spots
- 26% of COS parents who would otherwise work stay home due to childcare challenges (UCCS study)
- Fort Carson childcare shortage described as a military readiness issue; military drives 40% of the region's economy
- COS Chamber of Commerce & EDC identified childcare as a top 4 policy issue for the region
- Proposed zoning change would allow "small" daycare (6-15 kids) in R-1 (single-family) residential zones
- Proposed zoning change would allow "large" daycare (unlimited kids) in R-2 (two-family) residential zones
- Current requirement that daycare facilities be located on collector or arterial streets would be removed under the proposal
- City Planning Department placed the zoning changes on a "fast track" with no published rationale for the accelerated schedule
- Homeowners' associations expressed concern about haste — public announcement came only 4 days before the first public meeting
- An open house was held Feb 3; public feedback is being used to refine the proposal before it goes to planning commission
- The proposal represents a shift from Feb 22 coverage, which focused on federal funding cuts — this is the local zoning response
- Older downtown neighborhoods are actively working with city planners and child support groups to shape the proposal
- The childcare gap is now framed as both an economic development problem and a neighborhood character concern

#### Freshness Verification

- **Reported by:** Colorado Springs Gazette, KRDO, KKTV
- **First Reported:** January 31, 2026 (KKTV public input story)
- **Latest Update:** February 20, 2026 (Gazette guest column with full data)
- **Aging Status:** FRESH — active policy process with ongoing public feedback period
- **Confidence Level:** High — multiple local news outlets, official city planning process, named data sources (UCCS study, Chamber & EDC)

#### Why This Matters (to COS Parenting audience)

This is the single most consequential local story for COS parents right now, and it has evolved significantly since our Feb 22 coverage. The story has shifted from the federal angle (funding cuts) to the local response (zoning fast-track). The core tension is real and deeply personal: parents desperate for childcare are watching a city government try to solve the problem by allowing daycares in neighborhoods that have never had them — and some of those neighborhoods are pushing back. The 47,000-vs-18,400 gap is staggering and puts hard numbers on what every COS parent already knows from experience.

The fast-track element adds a layer of urgency and controversy. Whether you think the city is finally doing something or bulldozing neighborhood input, this zoning change will directly affect where your kids can go to daycare, what your street looks like, and how quickly new spots open. Military families at Fort Carson — a massive segment of the COS parenting population — are especially affected, since the childcare shortage is now officially described as a readiness issue for the installation.

#### Cross-Story Connections

- **Relates to Story #3:** Spring Break scheduling chaos
  - Connection: The childcare gap does not take a break during spring break — parents scrambling for camp spots are experiencing the same supply shortage in a different form.
- **Relates to Story #5:** D20 Job Fair
  - Connection: The childcare workforce shortage is part of the crisis. D20 hiring may include early childhood positions that help address the gap.

   - Type: National news coverage

#### Key Facts & Stats

- YCXXKJ baby bath seats: approximately 9,000 units recalled, sold on Amazon for $34-$40
- Bath seat hazard: seats are unstable and can tip over, creating a drowning risk for infants
- Uuoeebb infant walkers: approximately 2,650 units recalled, sold on Amazon for $60-$90
- Walker hazards: can fit through standard doorways, fail to stop at the edge of a step, and pose head entrapment risk
- Joyful Journeys baby loungers: sides are too low to contain an infant, openings at the foot are wider than the federal standard allows, and no stand means fall hazard on elevated surfaces
- AiTuiTui pull string teething toys: silicone strings are smaller than the minimum permitted size, can reach the back of an infant's throat, creating a choking and death risk
- All four recalled products were primarily sold through Amazon
- CPSC instructs consumers to immediately stop using all recalled products
- This is the second consecutive week of infant/child product recalls covered by COS Parenting (Feb 22 covered sleepwear, swings, and essential oil)
- Fox Business national coverage highlights that Amazon's third-party marketplace is the common thread across these recalls
- None of the recalled brands are well-known names — all are third-party Amazon marketplace sellers

#### Freshness Verification

- **Reported by:** CPSC.gov (primary), Fox Business (national coverage)
- **First Reported:** February 2026 (recall notices posted throughout the month)
- **Latest Update:** February 2026 (Fox Business coverage consolidating multiple recalls)
- **Aging Status:** FRESH — recalls are active and products may still be in COS homes
- **Confidence Level:** High — official federal agency recall notices with specific unit counts and hazard descriptions

#### Why This Matters (to COS Parenting audience)

This is the second straight week of serious infant product recalls, and the pattern is impossible to ignore: lesser-known brands sold through Amazon's marketplace, all violating mandatory federal safety standards, all posing death or serious injury risks. If you bought baby gear on Amazon in the past year — and most COS parents have — you need to check your home. Bath seats, walkers, loungers, and teething toys are everyday items in households with babies and toddlers. The specific hazards are terrifying: a bath seat that can tip over and drown your baby, a walker that will not stop at the top of stairs, a lounger that cannot contain your infant, and teething toy strings that can reach the back of a baby's throat.

The Amazon marketplace angle is the through-line. These are not recalls from Fisher-Price or Graco — these are from brands most parents have never heard of, bought because the price was right and the reviews looked fine. COS parents need to know that the Amazon listing looking like a deal might be a product that has never been properly tested against US safety standards. This is urgent, actionable, and directly relevant to every family with a child under 2.

#### Cross-Story Connections

- **Relates to Story #1:** Childcare crisis and zoning
  - Connection: As more home-based daycares potentially open under new zoning rules, product safety in those facilities becomes even more critical. Parents will want to know what equipment is in the daycare their child attends.
- **Relates to Story #3 and #7:** Spring break planning
  - Connection: Parents buying travel gear and portable baby items for spring break trips should be extra cautious about Amazon marketplace purchases.

### STORY 3: Spring Break 2026: Every COS District Has Different Dates

**Decision:** NEW STORY
**History Reference:** —
**Tier:** 2

   - URL: https://www.asd20.org/
   - Type: Official school district website

#### Key Facts & Stats

- D49 spring break: March 16-27, 2026 — two full weeks off
- Fountain-Fort Carson D8 spring break: March 23-27, 2026 — one week
- D20 and D11 spring break dates to be confirmed from their posted district calendars
- At minimum, D49 and D8 have overlapping but different break windows
- D49's two-week break is double the length of D8's one-week break
- Parents with children in different districts face scheduling conflicts with no overlapping free week guaranteed
- Spring break is 3-4 weeks away — camp and childcare booking windows are closing now
- This is a recurring annual frustration for COS families but rarely covered as a standalone story
- The different schedules compound the existing childcare shortage — parents need coverage for different weeks
- Military families stationed at Fort Carson often have children in both D8 and D49, making the mismatch especially painful
- No regional coordination mechanism exists to align spring break dates across El Paso County districts

#### Freshness Verification

- **Reported by:** Official school district calendars (D49, D8, D11, D20)
- **First Reported:** Calendars published at start of 2025-2026 school year
- **Latest Update:** Calendars are static — dates are set
- **Aging Status:** FRESH for audience relevance — spring break is 3-4 weeks away and booking deadlines are imminent
- **Confidence Level:** High — official district sources for confirmed dates; D20 and D11 dates pending verification from their calendars

#### Why This Matters (to COS Parenting audience)

Every COS parent with school-age kids is about to hit the spring break wall, and this year the scheduling chaos is worse than usual. D49 gets two full weeks off while D8 gets one — and they only partially overlap. If you have one kid in D49 and another in D8 (or friends/family across districts), you are looking at potentially three different weeks where someone is out of school. That means three weeks of childcare arrangements, camp registrations, and schedule juggling.

This story is pure service journalism. Camp spots are filling up now. Parents who have not booked childcare or activities for their district's specific break week are running out of time. The story also connects directly to the childcare crisis — the 28,600-spot deficit does not magically improve during spring break when every parent is scrambling for the same limited camp and activity slots. COS Parenting can be the resource that lays out all the dates in one place and tells parents exactly when they need to act.

#### Cross-Story Connections

- **Relates to Story #1:** Childcare crisis
  - Connection: The spring break childcare scramble is a seasonal symptom of the year-round childcare shortage.
- **Relates to Story #7:** Humor piece on spring break scheduling
  - Connection: Story 7 is the comedic companion to this factual service piece — same underlying frustration, different tone.
- **Relates to Story #5:** D20 and D11 updates
  - Connection: D20 and D11 spring break dates round out the full picture for COS families.

### STORY 4: Letting Teens Sleep In on Weekends May Cut Depression Risk 41%

   - URL: https://www.phillyvoice.com/mental-health-teens-sleep-depression/
   - Type: Regional news coverage

#### Key Facts & Stats

- Study conducted by University of Oregon and SUNY Upstate Medical University
- Published in the Journal of Affective Disorders (peer-reviewed)
- Analyzed approximately 1,100 young people ages 16-24 using NHANES data from 2021-2023
- Weekend catch-up sleep associated with a 41% lower risk of depression symptoms
- Healthy weekday sleep (8-10 hours per night) offers roughly twice the protective benefit of weekend catch-up alone
- This is the first study of weekend catch-up sleep effects on typical US adolescents — previous research was conducted in China and South Korea
- Depression rates among adolescents have risen steadily over the past 20 years in the US
- Teens naturally tend to stay up later due to shifting circadian rhythms during puberty
- Early school start times limit weeknight sleep, creating a structural sleep deficit for most teens
- Lead researcher Casement: "It's normal for teens to be night owls, so let them catch up on sleep on weekends"
- The study does not claim weekend sleep replaces adequate weeknight sleep — it measures the protective effect when weeknight sleep is insufficient
- NHANES is a nationally representative dataset, strengthening the study's applicability to COS families

#### Freshness Verification

- **Reported by:** ScienceDaily, US News, EurekAlert, PhillyVoice
- **First Reported:** January 6, 2026 (ScienceDaily)
- **Latest Update:** January 9, 2026 (US News)
- **Aging Status:** RECENT — published 6-7 weeks ago, not yet widely covered in local/parenting media; still highly relevant as the finding is actionable and evergreen
- **Confidence Level:** High — peer-reviewed study in a respected journal, nationally representative data, multiple credible outlets covered it

#### Why This Matters (to COS Parenting audience)

Every COS parent of a teenager has had the Saturday morning debate: should I let them sleep until noon, or drag them out of bed? This study gives parents scientific permission to let the teens sleep. A 41% reduction in depression risk from something as simple as weekend catch-up sleep is a massive finding, especially given how much teen mental health has deteriorated over the past two decades. For COS families dealing with the pressures of military life, high-altitude athletic schedules, and early school start times, this is directly actionable advice.

The study also validates what many parents intuitively know but feel guilty about: teens are not being lazy when they sleep late on weekends — their biology is literally wired for later sleep during adolescence. The caveat is important too — weekend sleep is not a substitute for adequate weeknight sleep, which means the conversation about school start times and evening screen habits still matters. But for this weekend, the message is simple: let them sleep.

#### Cross-Story Connections

- **Relates to Story #3:** Spring break scheduling
  - Connection: Spring break is a natural catch-up sleep opportunity for teens — two weeks off (in D49's case) could be genuinely restorative if parents protect sleep time.
- **Relates to Story #5:** D11 STEM Challenge
  - Connection: Academic performance and mental health are linked — teens who are rested perform better in challenges like D11's STEM program.

### STORY 5: D20 Spring Job Fair Saturday + D11 Launches STEM Challenge

**Decision:** NEW + FOLLOW UP (Feb 22 Story 4 noted D20 Job Fair as follow-up)

   - Type: Official school district update

#### Key Facts & Stats

- D20 Spring Job Fair: Saturday, February 28, 2026, at Liberty High School, starting at 9 AM
- The job fair was flagged in Feb 22 coverage as an upcoming follow-up item
- D20 covers northern Colorado Springs and is one of the region's most sought-after districts
- D11 STEM Challenge: running February through April 2026
- The STEM Challenge is open to D11 students and represents a multi-month engagement opportunity
- D11 is also highlighting Palmer High School renovations with a February community engagement update
- D11 Alumni Spotlight: Twila Moon, a glaciologist whose career in science started in D11 schools
- The D20 job fair is relevant to parents seeking education-sector employment, including early childhood and support roles
- D11's STEM Challenge timing coincides with the spring semester push and science fair season
- Both districts are actively promoting engagement and community involvement heading into spring

#### Freshness Verification

- **Reported by:** Academy District 20 (official website), Colorado Springs D11 (official website)
- **First Reported:** February 2026 (both districts posting announcements)
- **Latest Update:** February 2026 (current website postings)
- **Aging Status:** FRESH — D20 Job Fair is 5 days away (Feb 28); D11 STEM Challenge is currently active
- **Confidence Level:** High — official school district sources

#### Why This Matters (to COS Parenting audience)

The D20 Job Fair is a direct follow-up from our Feb 22 coverage and hits multiple audience segments: parents looking for work (especially in education), parents considering D20 for school choice (seeing who is hiring signals where the district is growing), and anyone interested in the education workforce pipeline. The childcare crisis makes education-sector hiring especially relevant — more teachers and support staff means more capacity. Liberty High School on Saturday morning is an easy, low-barrier event for COS parents to attend.

D11's STEM Challenge is a different kind of opportunity — it is about what your kid can do, not what you as a parent need to figure out. STEM challenges build skills, confidence, and college-ready resumes. The Twila Moon alumni spotlight is a nice local proof point: a real person who went through D11 schools and became a scientist. For parents trying to get their kids excited about academics during the spring semester lull, this is timely. The Palmer renovations update matters too — D11 families want to know what is happening with one of the city's historic schools.

#### Cross-Story Connections

- **Relates to Story #1:** Childcare crisis
  - Connection: Education workforce hiring (D20 Job Fair) is part of the solution to the childcare and teacher shortage.
- **Relates to Story #3:** Spring break scheduling
  - Connection: D20 and D11 spring break dates are part of the scheduling chaos story — and both districts are trying to keep families engaged heading into break.
- **Relates to Story #4:** Teen sleep and mental health
  - Connection: The D11 STEM Challenge is the kind of structured, engaging academic activity that gives teens purpose — a complement to the rest and recovery teens need.

### STORY 6: Family Day at Starsmore + Special Olympics Plunge Coming Up

   - Type: Community event roundup

#### Key Facts & Stats

- Starsmore Discovery Center Family Day: Saturday, February 28, 2026, starting at 9 AM
- Starsmore is located at the entrance to North Cheyenne Canon Park — one of COS's most family-friendly natural areas
- Programming includes nature and science activities designed for families with young children
- Additional Starsmore family sessions scheduled for March 28 and April 25, 2026
- Colorado Springs Plunge & 5K: Saturday, March 7, 2026, starting at 9 AM at Rock Ledge Ranch
- The Plunge & 5K benefits Special Olympics Colorado
- Rock Ledge Ranch is a well-known COS venue adjacent to Garden of the Gods
- Pikes Peak Hospice Patriotic Blanket Drive runs through March 2 — a family-friendly service opportunity
- Both the Starsmore event and the Plunge are free or low-cost family activities
- The Starsmore series provides recurring monthly family programming through spring

#### Freshness Verification

- **Reported by:** PeakRadar, Colorado Springs Gazette
- **First Reported:** February 22, 2026 (Gazette event roundup)
- **Latest Update:** February 2026 (current listings)
- **Aging Status:** FRESH — Starsmore event is 5 days away; Plunge is 12 days away
- **Confidence Level:** High — established community venues and organizations with published event details

#### Why This Matters (to COS Parenting audience)

Free and low-cost family activities are always in demand, and these two events hit different but equally valuable notes. Starsmore Discovery Center is a COS gem that many newer families (especially military families who recently PCS'd to Fort Carson or Peterson) may not know about. A nature and science family day at the entrance to North Cheyenne Canon is exactly the kind of weekend activity that makes living in Colorado Springs special. The fact that it recurs monthly through spring means parents can build it into their routine.

The Special Olympics Plunge & 5K is a different energy — it is a community event that teaches kids about giving back, and it is at Rock Ledge Ranch, which is already a favorite family destination. For parents looking for ways to model service and community involvement, this is an easy on-ramp. The blanket drive through March 2 is also a simple way to involve kids in helping others. These are the "what should we do this weekend?" answers that COS Parenting readers rely on.

#### Cross-Story Connections

- **Relates to Story #3:** Spring break scheduling
  - Connection: Starsmore's March 28 session falls during or near spring break for some districts — a potential break activity.
- **Relates to Story #5:** D20 Job Fair
  - Connection: The Starsmore Family Day and D20 Job Fair are both on Saturday, Feb 28 — parents may need to choose or split the day.

### STORY 7: The 5 Stages of Planning Spring Break When Every District Has Different Dates

**Decision:** NEW STORY (Humor)
**History Reference:** —
**Tier:** 3

#### Sources & Publication Dates

1. Humor/editorial — based on factual spring break date differences documented in Story 3
   - URL: N/A (original content)
   - Type: Humor/editorial

#### Key Facts & Stats

- Plays on the five stages of grief: Denial, Anger, Bargaining, Depression, Acceptance
- Grounded in the real scheduling chaos caused by different COS district spring break dates
- D49 gets two full weeks (March 16-27); D8 gets one week (March 23-27); D20 and D11 dates vary
- Denial: "Wait, D49 has TWO weeks off? That can't be right."
- Anger: "Why can't these districts coordinate? We live in the same city."
- Bargaining: "Maybe Grandma can take the D49 kid for week one and the D8 kid for week two."
- Depression: "I just checked camp prices. For both weeks. For two kids."
- Acceptance: "Screen time limits are suspended March 16 through March 27. This is fine."
- High share potential among parents with kids in different districts or friends across district lines
- Relatable to military families who move between districts during a PCS cycle
- The humor format makes a genuinely frustrating logistics problem feel communal rather than isolating

#### Freshness Verification

- **Reported by:** Original COS Parenting humor content
- **First Reported:** N/A — original editorial
- **Latest Update:** N/A — to be published Feb 23, 2026
- **Aging Status:** FRESH — timely as spring break approaches in 3-4 weeks
- **Confidence Level:** High — humor is based on verified factual spring break date discrepancies from Story 3

#### Why This Matters (to COS Parenting audience)

Humor content is the highest-share category in parenting media, and this piece is built on a frustration that is universal among COS parents. The different spring break dates across districts is not a new problem, but it is one that hits families hard every single year and rarely gets acknowledged publicly. By naming the stages — from denial through acceptance — this piece tells parents "you are not alone in thinking this is absurd." That validation is powerful and shareable.

The humor format also serves a strategic purpose: it drives traffic to the factual spring break dates coverage in Story 3. Parents who laugh at the humor piece will click through to the service piece to get the actual dates. The two stories work as a pair — one for the heart, one for the calendar. Military families who PCS into COS mid-year and discover the scheduling chaos for the first time are an especially strong audience for this content.

#### Cross-Story Connections

- **Relates to Story #3:** Spring break dates (factual companion piece)
  - Connection: This humor piece is the emotional/comedic companion to Story 3's factual service coverage. They are designed to work as a pair.
- **Relates to Story #1:** Childcare crisis
  - Connection: The "Depression" stage (camp prices) is a direct callback to the childcare affordability crisis.
- **Relates to Story #4:** Teen sleep
  - Connection: The "Acceptance" stage could include "At least the teenagers will finally get enough sleep" as a callback to Story 4.

## Notes for Next Phase (Story Analysis)

- Story 1 (Childcare Zoning) has evolved from Feb 22 — the angle is now local zoning controversy, not federal cuts. Lead with the tension between desperate parents and concerned neighborhoods.
- Story 2 (CPSC Recalls) is the second consecutive week of infant product recalls. The Amazon marketplace pattern is the new angle — frame it as a systemic issue, not just individual recalls.
- Story 3 (Spring Break Dates) is pure service journalism — get the dates right, include booking deadlines, and make it the definitive COS reference.
- Story 4 (Teen Sleep) is a strong "permission slip" story — parents will share this as validation. Lead with the 41% stat.
- Story 5 (D20/D11) is a combined district update — keep it scannable with clear dates, times, and locations.
- Story 6 (Events) is a weekend/upcoming calendar play — Starsmore is the discovery for newer COS families.
- Story 7 (Humor) must land the comedy while driving traffic to Story 3. Keep the stages punchy and deeply specific to COS.
