            <h2>What's Been Recalled</h2>

            <p>We need to talk about four product recalls that just came through the Consumer Product Safety Commission, and honestly, these are the kind that make your stomach drop. We're talking about a baby bath seat that can tip over, an infant walker that won't stop at stairs, a lounger that can't safely contain your baby, and a teething toy with parts that can reach the back of your child's throat. All four were primarily sold on Amazon, so if you've done any baby-gear shopping there recently, keep reading.</p>

            <p>Here's the most important thing first: if you have any of these products, stop using them immediately. Not after nap time, not after bath tonight. Right now. We'll walk you through exactly what to look for and what to do next.</p>

            <h2>The Details: What to Check and What to Do</h2>

            <h3>YCXXKJ Baby Bath Seats</h3>

            <p>This one's urgent. Approximately 9,000 of these bath seats were sold on Amazon at prices between $34 and $40, and they pose a drowning risk. The seats are unstable and can tip over while your baby is in the water. That's not a minor design flaw — that's a life-threatening hazard. The CPSC found that these seats violate the mandatory federal safety standard for infant bath seats, which means they should never have been sold in the first place.</p>

            <p>What to do: Stop using the bath seat immediately. Do not use it even with supervision. Contact YCXXKJ or Amazon for a full refund, and in the meantime, go back to bathing your baby in a flat-bottom infant tub or in the sink with your hands on them the entire time.</p>

            <h3>Uuoeebb Infant Walkers</h3>

            <p>About 2,650 units of these walkers were sold on Amazon for $60 to $90, and they've got multiple problems. The walkers can fit through a standard doorway (which means your baby can roll right into another room or toward stairs), they fail to stop at the edge of a step (fall hazard), and there's a head entrapment risk through the leg openings. Any one of those issues alone would be enough for a recall. Together, they make this product genuinely dangerous.</p>

            <p>What to do: Stop using the walker immediately. Don't try to modify it or add barriers as a workaround — the product itself is the problem. Contact Uuoeebb or Amazon for a refund. If your child is at the cruising stage, consider a stationary activity center instead, which gives them the upright play experience without the mobility risks.</p>

            <h3>Joyful Journeys Baby Loungers</h3>

            <p>These loungers have multiple design failures that violate the federal infant sleep product safety standard. The sides are too low to safely contain an infant, the foot-end openings are wider than what's allowed, and the lounger has no stand — meaning if you place it on a couch, table, or bed, there's nothing stopping it (and your baby) from sliding off the edge.</p>

            <p>What to do: Stop using the lounger immediately, especially for sleep or on any elevated surface. Contact Joyful Journeys or Amazon for a refund. For safe sleep, stick with a firm, flat surface with a fitted sheet — your baby's crib, bassinet, or play yard. No inclines, no soft padding, no loungers.</p>

            <h3>AiTuiTui Pull-String Teething Toys</h3>

            <p>These teething toys have silicone pull strings that are smaller than federal standards permit. That matters because strings that thin can reach the back of a child's throat and become lodged there, causing respiratory distress and posing a choking and death risk. Teething toys are designed to go in your baby's mouth, so this isn't a "what if" scenario — it's exactly how the product is used.</p>

            <p>What to do: Take this toy away from your child immediately and do not let them play with it. Contact AiTuiTui or Amazon for a refund. For teething relief, stick with one-piece silicone teethers that don't have small strings, ribbons, or detachable parts.</p>

            <h2>How to Stay on Top of Recalls</h2>

            <p>Here's the reality: recalls happen constantly, and most of them never make the evening news. If you want to stay ahead of them (and you should), there are a few simple steps that take less than five minutes to set up.</p>

            <p>First, bookmark cpsc.gov/recalls. That's the Consumer Product Safety Commission's dedicated recall page, and it's updated as soon as new recalls are announced. You can search by product type, brand, or date — so if you just bought something on Amazon and want to double-check, this is where to look.</p>

            <p>Second, sign up for CPSC email alerts at cpsc.gov. You can customize what you receive, so you're not getting flooded with commercial kitchen equipment recalls if all you care about is baby and children's products. Once you're signed up, the recalls come straight to your inbox.</p>

            <p>Third, check your Amazon order history periodically. Several of the products in today's recalls were sold primarily or exclusively through Amazon. Amazon does send recall notifications for some products, but don't rely on that alone. A quick search of your past orders against the CPSC recall list once a month is a solid habit.</p>

            <p>And if you ever have a question or concern about a product's safety, you can call the CPSC hotline directly at 800-638-2772. Real people answer, and they can help you figure out whether a product you own is affected by a recall.</p>

            <h2>What's Next</h2>

            <p>We'll keep monitoring the CPSC for new recalls that affect families, and we'll flag anything that Colorado Springs parents need to know about. Product safety isn't the most exciting topic in parenting, but it's one of the most important — and staying informed is one of the simplest ways to keep your kids safe.</p>

            <p>If you found any of these recalled products in your home, take action today. And if you know other parents who shop on Amazon for baby gear (so, basically all of us), share this article. The more families who check, the fewer kids are at risk.</p>
