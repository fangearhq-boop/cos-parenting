The COS childcare crisis by the numbers: 47,000 kids under 5. Only 18,400 licensed spots. That's a gap of nearly 29,000 kids without a seat. The city's proposing a fix--but it's complicated. Let's break it down. #COSParenting #COSKids

**Tweet 2:**
The plan: Fast-track zoning changes to allow daycare centers in residential neighborhoods. This could unlock thousands of new spots by removing red tape for in-home and small providers. For many families, this can't come soon enough.

**Tweet 3:**
The pushback: Neighborhood groups say the process is moving too fast. They want more community input on traffic, parking, and noise before residential zones change. Both sides have valid points. #ColoradoSprings #PikesPeakParenting

Bottom line: COS families need solutions NOW. But residents deserve a voice too. What matters most to you--speed or process? Drop your thoughts below. We're following this closely. #COSParenting #COSKids
