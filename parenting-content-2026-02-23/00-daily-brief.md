## Story Details

### STORY 1: COS Childcare Crisis: Zoning Fast-Track Sparks Neighborhood Debate
**Content Pillar:** Local News
**Freshness Tag:** DEVELOPING
**Tier:** 1
**Assigned Platforms:** Article, X Text Post, X Thread, Facebook Long-Form, Facebook Image Caption, Image Concepts (X + FB)
**Priority Score:** 9

**Decision:** FOLLOW UP (Feb 22, Story 1: "COS Childcare Crisis: Federal Cuts Meet Local Shortage")

**Summary:** Colorado Springs' childcare crisis continues to make headlines. The Gazette published a new piece on Feb 20 highlighting the severity of the shortage — 47,000 kids under 5 but only 18,400 licensed spots. New angle: the city's proposed zoning changes are on a "fast track" to City Council, with neighborhood groups pushing back on the speed. City planners, childcare advocates, and downtown neighborhood associations are in active discussion, with a Feb 3 open house already completed and planning commission review coming next. This follow-up shifts from the federal funding angle to the local zoning solution and the community debate around it.

### STORY 2: CPSC Safety Alert: Baby Bath Seats, Walkers, and Loungers Recalled
**Content Pillar:** National Parenting
**Freshness Tag:** TODAY
**Tier:** 1
**Assigned Platforms:** Article, X Text Post, X Thread, Facebook Long-Form, Facebook Image Caption, Image Concepts (X + FB)
**Priority Score:** 10

**Decision:** FOLLOW UP (Feb 22, Story 5: "CPSC Recalls: Children's Sleepwear and Baby Swings")

**Summary:** Another wave of CPSC recalls directly affecting COS parents who shop on Amazon. The biggest: YCXXKJ baby bath seats recalled for drowning risk (9,000 units, sold for $34-$40 on Amazon). Also recalled: Uuoeebb infant walkers (fall/entrapment, 2,650 units), Joyful Journeys baby loungers (entrapment/fall), and AiTuiTui pull-string teething toys (choking). All were sold primarily through Amazon. Highest priority because these are active death risks for infants and toddlers.

**Content Pillar:** Local News
**Freshness Tag:** UPCOMING
**Tier:** 2
**Assigned Platforms:** X Text Post, Facebook Long-Form, Facebook Image Caption, Image Concepts (X + FB)
**Priority Score:** 8

**Decision:** NEW STORY

**Summary:** Spring break planning season is here, and COS parents with kids in different districts are about to discover the scheduling chaos. D49 has a massive two-week break (March 16-27), Fountain-Fort Carson is March 23-27, and D20/D11 dates vary. This matters NOW because parents need to book camps, arrange childcare, and coordinate with friends in different districts. Practical, high-value planning content that drives engagement through shared frustration.

### STORY 4: Letting Teens Sleep In on Weekends May Cut Depression Risk 41%
**Content Pillar:** National Parenting
**Freshness Tag:** TRENDING
**Tier:** 2
**Assigned Platforms:** X Text Post, Facebook Long-Form, Facebook Image Caption, Image Concepts (X + FB)
**Priority Score:** 7

**Decision:** NEW STORY

**Summary:** University of Oregon study published in Journal of Affective Disorders found that teens who catch up on sleep on weekends have a 41% lower risk of depression symptoms. Study analyzed ~1,100 young people ages 16-24 from NHANES data. Researchers say it's normal for teens to be night owls and parents should let them sleep in when possible. With depression rates rising among adolescents over the past 20 years, this is reassuring data for COS parents of teens.

**Content Pillar:** Local Events
**Freshness Tag:** UPCOMING
**Tier:** 2
**Assigned Platforms:** X Text Post, Facebook Long-Form, Facebook Image Caption, Image Concepts (X + FB)
**Priority Score:** 6

**Decision:** NEW STORY + FOLLOW UP (Feb 22, Story 4: "D20 School Choice Window Open Through March 13" — Job Fair was noted as follow-up opportunity)

**Summary:** Two school district highlights for the week ahead. D20's Spring Job Fair is this Saturday, Feb 28, at Liberty High School starting at 9 AM — great for parents looking for education careers or wanting to learn about open positions. Meanwhile, D11 has launched a STEM Challenge running February through April, giving students hands-on problem-solving experience. Both events show COS school districts investing in community engagement.

**Content Pillar:** Local Events
**Freshness Tag:** UPCOMING
**Tier:** 3
**Assigned Platforms:** X Text Post, Facebook Long-Form, Facebook Image Caption, Image Concepts (X + FB)
**Priority Score:** 5

**Decision:** NEW STORY

**Summary:** Two upcoming family-friendly events to have on the radar. Starsmore Discovery Center hosts its next Family Programming Day on Saturday, Feb 28, starting at 9 AM — a great free nature and science outing.

### STORY 7: The 5 Stages of Planning Spring Break When Every District Has Different Dates
**Content Pillar:** Humor
**Freshness Tag:** EVERGREEN
**Tier:** 3
**Assigned Platforms:** X Text Post, Facebook Long-Form, Facebook Image Caption, Image Concepts (X + FB)
**Priority Score:** 4

**Decision:** NEW STORY

**Summary:** A humor play on the universal COS parent frustration of spring break scheduling. When your kid is in D49, your friend's kid is in D11, and your neighbor's kid is in Fountain-Fort Carson — nobody's spring break overlaps. The 5 stages: Denial ("surely they're the same week"), Anger ("WHO designed these calendars?"), Bargaining ("maybe grandma can take them for the extra week"), Depression ("I just need to book three separate childcare plans"), and Acceptance ("at least it's not summer scheduling"). High share potential.
