## STORY 1: COS Childcare Crisis: Zoning Fast-Track Sparks Neighborhood Debate
**Tier:** 1 (Top Priority)
**Topic:** 47,000 kids under 5 but only 18,400 licensed spots; city zoning fast-track; neighborhood pushback

### X Image (1200x675 px)

**Visual Description:**
A warm, editorial-style shot of a small home-based daycare in a Colorado Springs residential neighborhood. Through the front window, two or three toddlers are visible playing with colorful blocks on the floor while a caregiver sits nearby. The front yard shows a residential street with mature trees, a low fence, and neighboring houses. Late morning light casts warm shadows across the porch. The upper third of the frame is open blue Colorado sky with a hint of Pikes Peak in the distance, providing clear space for text overlay. The mood is warm and community-centered but carries a subtle tension between the cozy daycare scene and the quiet neighborhood surroundings.

**Gemini Image Prompt:**
Photorealistic editorial photograph of a charming home-based daycare in a Colorado Springs residential neighborhood, shot from the sidewalk looking toward the front of a modest single-story house with a covered porch. Through the large front window, two toddlers of different ethnicities are visible sitting on a colorful rug playing with wooden blocks, with a female caregiver in her 30s sitting cross-legged nearby smiling at them. The front yard has a small white picket fence, a few bare winter trees, and a tidy sidewalk. Neighboring houses are visible on both sides. Late morning winter sunlight illuminates the scene with warm golden tones. The upper third of the frame is open blue Colorado sky with the faint silhouette of Pikes Peak on the horizon. No text, no words, no logos, no signs. Warm and inviting but with an authentic neighborhood feel. Shot at 1200x675 pixels, 16:9 aspect ratio. Leave the upper third as open sky for text overlay.

**Text Overlay Copy:**
- **Headline:** "Childcare Crisis: Zoning Fast-Track Hits Neighborhoods" (Poppins Bold, #FFFFFF)
- **Subtitle:** "47K kids, 18K spots. City Council moves on zoning changes." (Nunito Semi-Bold, #F4C542)

The kitchen is bright and modern with white cabinets and warm wood countertops. Morning sunlight streams through a window to the left. The mood is genuinely funny and relatable. No text, no words, no logos, no readable writing on calendars or sticky notes. Warm and inviting editorial photography style with a humorous quality. Shot at 1200x630 pixels, 1.91:1 aspect ratio. Leave the upper portion as clean kitchen wall for text overlay.

**Text Overlay Copy:**
- **Headline:** "The 5 Stages of Planning COS Spring Break" (Poppins Bold, #FFFFFF)
- **Subtitle:** "When every district has different dates..." (Nunito Semi-Bold, #F4C542)

**Composition Notes:**
- Overlay bar: Semi-transparent Dark Slate (#2C3E50) at 80% opacity, positioned across the lower third
- Same text treatment as X version
- Tighter vertical crop puts parent's expression more prominently in view
- Calendar chaos on counter still dominant visual element
- Wall calendar in background still partially visible
- Ensure overlay bar does not obscure calendars on the counter
- Humorous, warm tone preserved in tighter frame

1. **Generate base images only** — no text, words, logos, or watermarks
2. **Specify exact dimensions** in each prompt (1200x675 or 1200x630)
3. **Request photorealistic, editorial photography style** consistently
4. **Include "No text, no words, no logos"** in every prompt
5. **Request open space** (upper third or upper portion) for text overlay zone
6. **Add text overlays in Canva** using brand kit after image generation
