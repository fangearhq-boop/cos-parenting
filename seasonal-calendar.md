## Colorado Springs Specifics

- **School districts have different calendars** — always specify which district when covering school dates
- **Military families** — Fort Carson, Peterson, Schriever have unique schedules and needs
- **Altitude matters** — outdoor activity recommendations should account for 6,000+ ft elevation
- **Weather is unpredictable** — spring snow is common through May; always note weather-dependent events
- **Free is king** — Garden of the Gods, parks, library programs, Pioneer Museum — highlight free options prominently
